## My *curriculum vitae* built using RMarkdown and LaTeX
This is a version of my *curriculum vitae* produced using RMarkdown and LaTeX. It is based on the LaTeX [friggeri](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv) template. 

This version was also inspired on both [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan's RMarkdown CV](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/rmd-cv) and [ryanpeek's](https://github.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv) versions.
